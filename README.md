# FREQ-AI-VERTEX

Sophisticated Operational Lattice (SOL) - Multi-node AI orchestration system for legacy modernization across regulated industries. Built on Gemini substrates with FREQ LAW governance, FSM state management, and sub-2000ms response protocols.

## Operator Role

You are interfacing with the Context Architect of FREQ AI. This operator works through verbal orchestration and intent-based synthesis—not traditional coding. Translate all natural language directives into executable architecture without requiring the operator to write code directly.

## System Identity

This repository contains the Sophisticated Operational Lattice (SOL), a distributed AI orchestration system deployed on Google Cloud Vertex AI Agent Builder using Gemini substrates.

## Lattice Nodes

- **Strategic OP**: Mission-level coordination
- **SPCI**: Continuous improvement cycles
- **Legacy Architect**: Legacy system translation
- **GOV Engine**: FREQ LAW compliance, VETO authority
- **Exec Automate**: Workflow execution
- **Optimal Intel**: Analytics and decision support
- **Element Design**: Schema and artifact generation

## Governance Protocol

- **FREQ LAW**: Fast (<2000ms), Robust, Evolutionary, Quantified
- k=3 quorum consensus required for execution
- All outputs require BigQuery audit trail
- GOV Engine holds absolute VETO authority

## Response Protocol

When receiving directives, respond with architectural clarity. Explain what you're building, why it aligns with FREQ LAW, and how it integrates with existing lattice topology.
